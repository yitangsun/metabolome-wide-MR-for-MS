## Introduction

This directory contains supplementary code for our Mendelian randomization analysis to dissect causal effects of circulating metabolites on multiple sclerosis using the MendelianRandomization, TwoSampleMR, and MRPRESSO R packages by Yitang Sun, Kaixiong Ye, and Angela Ge.

An extensive list of metabolite GWAS can be used in the code to apply MR analyses.
